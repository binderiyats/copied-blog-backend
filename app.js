In 2023, some will celebrate The Year of the Rabbit. But our friends in Vietnamese communities will celebrate this coming Lunar New Year with a different furry friend. For them, 2023 (and every 12 years) is The Year of the Cat.This is my creative journey to uncover why this is the case.',

What makes Blank Street worthy of such rapid expansion?Blank Street’s vision: somewhat cheaper coffee.According to Blank Street, the brand’s founders Issam Freiha and Vinay Menda (who happen to be venture capitalists themselves) created the brand with a simple mission: to make good coffee cheaper.',

Our first iteration, to our Basque language Wikipedia, was in fact deployed as far back as July 2020. We’ve built responsibly, intentionally, and strategically, thinking holistically about the entire behemoth that is our codebase.

Not bad.But how much money is that?For reference, more than Portugal’s expected entire GDP for 2022.In other words, Google’s revenues in 2021 were bigger than what Portugal managed to produce, as an entire country, for a whole year.Seeing those numbers, one can’t act surprised by Google’s insane valuation.Or should we?Truth be told, Google’s business model has a catch.Diversification isn’t Google’s strongest suit.It’s undeniable that Google has some impressive numbers.As a more visual representation, let’s look at the following monographic',
